    random_action(game_state::GameState) -> Int

Get paddle movement action using random movement strategy.

Uses probabilistic direction changes to create semi-realistic movement patterns
rather than completely random actions each frame.

# Arguments
- `game_state`: Current game state (ignored for random movement)

# Returns
- `-1`: Move paddle left
- `1`: Move paddle right  
- `0`: No movement
