    heuristic_action(game_state) -> Int

Get paddle movement action using ball-following heuristic strategy.

Implements a simple but effective strategy: move the paddle toward the ball's
horizontal position with a small dead zone to reduce jittery movement.

# Arguments
- `game_state`: Current game state tuple

# Returns
- `-1`: Move paddle left (ball is to the left)
- `1`: Move paddle right (ball is to the right)
- `0`: No movement (ball is approximately centered)
